            assignment 3. Here is the link to my course homepage:

    <string name="how_to_play">You are the explorer of Teyvat and you hope to find the characters
            of this world. Find them with the least amount of scans as possible to win.
            To search an area, click on the button to reveal that area. It may be a character or
            a clue. If it is a clue, then the scan counter will increase and a number will display
            on that area which indicates how many characters are on that row or on that column.
            If you find a character, then your scan counter will not increase. You may click on
            the character to ask him/her for a clue. This will also increase
            your scan counter.</string>
