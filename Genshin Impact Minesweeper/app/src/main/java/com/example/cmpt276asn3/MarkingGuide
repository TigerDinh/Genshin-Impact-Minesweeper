CMPT 276 Assignment 3 Marking Guide
for Dr. Brian's class

Assignment must be done individually or in pairs (2-students).
There is no difference in marking for individuals or pairs.

Total   = 100 marks
Maximum = 105 marks

[50] Functional Requirements
    All functional requirements are worth marks. Marking will pay special attention to:
    [30] Correct play of the game.
    [10] Works correctly with different size game boards and # mines.
	[5]  Options screen functions correctly, and values save between application executions
	     Must use a Singleton model class.
    [5]  Help screen with correctly hyperlinked text; splash screen; main-menu.

[25] Non-functional requirements
    All functional requirements must be completed. Marking will pay special attention to:
	[5] Application theme
	   - Nicely executed application theme.
       - Background on all screens (need not be very theme related)
    [10] Activity navigation
	   - All required activities present.
       - Buttons and menus lead between screens correctly.
       - Back-button correctly navigate up activity call stack.
	     (OK if back button on welcome screen does not work.)
	[10] Maintainable code
	   - Good code quality
	     Each class should have a comment explaining its purpose; individual functions need not.
		 All variables, classes, functions must have excellent names.
		 Reasonably small functions without deep nesting.
	   - Game logic in separate package from UI code

[10] Git Repository
	[10] Must have 3 issues, 3 feature branches merged to master.
	     Must have good commit messages on most commits.
	     (OK for some to be less meaningful when trying to work through GIT problems).
		 Marked via either screenshots, or GitLab directly.

	[-4] failure to generate a Git tag
    [-4] for not giving TA any permissions for repo.
    [-2] for giving TA insufficient permissions for repo (must be developer)

[15] "Optional" Features
	You may attempt any number of these optional features you like.
	List them in your docs/readme.txt file, as described in the assignment document.
	[ 5] Welcome screen: animation
	[ 3] Main menu: nice buttons and better than expected screen look
	[10] Game: Scanning animation along row/column when scanning for mines
	[ 3] Game: Play sound on scan and on find a mine
	[10] Game: Save game state if app closed while game playing.
	     - Restarting app restarts game where you were.
	[10] Display & Save # games started (total), and best score between launches.
	     - Options screen able to reset number games played to 0, and clear all high scores.
	     - Must store best score for each possible game configuration and display
	       the best score for the current configuration while playing the game.

General Deductions to be applied wholistically:
	[-5] for incorrect docs/ folder
    [-4] for not giving TA any permissions for repo.
    [-2] for giving TA insufficient permissions for repo (must be developer)
